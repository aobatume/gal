## 1. Background {#background}

### Goal Description {#goal-description}

Tourism in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in the livelihoods goal) but instead captures the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem. <!---**In the BHI, ....**--->

### Model & Data {#model-data}

Data for each country were downloaded from the [EU-Study on Blue Growth](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550), Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region” identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and at sea basin level.

```{=html}
<!---
The tourism model incorporates the nights of stay in accommodations and compare that to the reference point. 

We used Eurostat dataset on [nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2&lang=en) by all NUTS regions. [tour_occ_nin2] 
--->
```
### Reference points {#reference-points}

[Study in support of policy measures for maritime and coastal tourism at EU level](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/docs/body/study-maritime-and-coastal-tourism_en.pdf) (Page 157) states that the Nordic Countries sea basins tourism has a potential to grow annually by 2.2 % until 2020. We therefore set the target to an annual growth of 2.2% for ten years from 2010.

### Considerations for *BHI 2.0* {#considerations-for-bhi-2.0}

<!---MISSING data for region 19, 22, 30, 33 --->

### Other information {#other-information}

## 2. Data {#data}

Alternative 1 is based on regional accommodation data, and Alternative 2 on employment data from [EU-Study on Blue Growth](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550), Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region” as mentioned in the Background section, which was selected as the goal model.

Both approaches have been explored and recorded here.

### Alternative 1: Regional Accommodation Stays Data {#alternative-1-regional-accommodation-stays-data}

Eurostat dataset on Nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by all NUTS regions with the finest scale spatial resolution at NUTS2. [tour_occ_nin2](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2&lang=en)

#### Regional Accommodation Stays Coastal/Non-Coastal Data

Eurostat dataset on Nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area from 2012 onwards. These were download for all available region levels. [tour_occ_nin2c](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2c&lang=en) Download Date: 10 Feb 2016, Download By: Jennifer Griffiths

Selected all Geographic areas (includes NUTS0, NUTS1, NUTS2)

Selected all accommodation categories combined: hotels; holiday and other short-stay accommodation; camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks

Selected Total, and split between Coastal & non-coastal regions

Selected years available: 2012-2014

Missing data indicated by colon (:)

### Alternative 2: {#alternative-2}

The [“Study on Blue Growth, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550) identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States of the Baltic Sea Region, and also provided detailed marine revenue and employment by sector and in each BHI country. Saved in `prep/LIV/liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv`

Sectors isolated for Tourism and Recreation goal are *Coastal tourism, Yachting and maris, Cruise tourism*.

## 3. Goal Model {#goal-model}

### 3.1 Status Calculation - Alternative 1 {#status-calculation---alternative-1}

Xtr = a_r/a_ref_r

-   a_r = number of nights spent in coastal accommodations in BHI region r

-   a_ref_r = a_r - 5

-   r = BHI region

-   a_r = (proportion population in 25km buffer in nuts2 association with r) x a_c

-   n = NUTS2 region

-   a_c = coastal accommodation stays in NUTS2 region n

-   a_c = a_n x c_n1

-   a_n = accommodation stays in NUTS2 region_n

-   c_n1 = mean proportion of accommodations stays that are coastal at the NUTS1 level

### 3.1.2 Reference point - Alternative 1 {#reference-point---alternative-1}

We set reference point as 3% more than the most recent year. This figure came from [Study in support of policy measures for maritime and coastal tourism at EU level](http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/documentation/studies/documents/study-maritime-and-coastal-tourism_en.pdf)

"As part of EU's Blue Growth strategy, the coastal and maritime tourism sector has been identified as an area with special potential to foster a smart, sustainable and inclusive Europe. It is the biggest maritime sector in terms of gross value added and employment, and is expected to grow by 2-3% by 2020."

### 3.1.3 Trend calculation - Alternative 1 {#trend-calculation---alternative-1}

Linear regression fit to the most recent 5 status years.

### 3.2 Status Claculation - Alternative 2 {#status-claculation---alternative-2}

Xtr = employment_current / employment_ref

Sectors isolated for Tourism and Recreation goal are *Coastal tourism, Yachting and maris, Cruise tourism*.

### 3.2.2 Refrence point - Alternative 2 {#refrence-point---alternative-2}

Reference point is set to 2020, based on 2.2% annual growth from 2010 for the ten years based on [Study in support of policy measures for maritime and coastal tourism at EU level](https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/docs/body/study-maritime-and-coastal-tourism_en.pdf) (Page 157).

### 3.2.3 Trend calculation - Alternative 2 {#trend-calculation---alternative-2}

Trend is based on the same Blue Growth report (as in status calculations). Trend score for each country is weighted average of % growth in employment in each subsector (*Coastal tourism, Yachting and maris, Cruise tourism*), by their relative contribution to the total GVA in Tourism and Recreation.

## 4. Data Layer Preparation - Alternative 1 {#data-layer-preparation---alternative-1}

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide")

## set directory and load libraries
source('~/github/bhi/baltic2015/prep/common.r')
dir_tr = file.path(dir_prep, 'TR')

## add a README.md to the prep directory 
create_readme(dir_tr, 'tr_prep.rmd') 
```

### 4.1 Data cleaning and organizing {#data-cleaning-and-organizing}

#### 4.1.1 Read in data

``` r
## accomodation stays time series by NUTS region
accom = read.csv(file.path(dir_tr, "tr_data_database/accom.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# dim(accom)

## accomodation stays for 2012-2014 by NUTS region divided by the coastal and non-coastal fractions
accom_coast = read.csv(file.path(dir_tr, "tr_data_database/accom_coast.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# dim(accom_coast)

## NUTS2 population and area by BHI region fraction
nuts2_pop_area = read_csv(file.path(dir_tr, "tr_data_database/NUTS2_BHI_ID_Pop_density_in_buffer.csv"))

# dim(nuts2_pop_area)

## european country names and abbreviations
eu_names = read.csv(file.path(dir_prep,"EUcountrynames.csv"), sep=";", stringsAsFactors =FALSE)
```

#### 4.1.2 Clean Data

##### Acommodation stays time series

``` r
## Acommodation stays time series
# str(accom)
## need to remove the BHI_ID columns - these are from an old join to the BHI shapefile, not relevant now.
## need to rename columns
## these data contain all NUTS levels from level 2 up, need to have them be just NUTS2 -- will do this when join to NUTS2 population data, will then have only the NUTS2 from the shapefile. 
## value has : for NA, fix

accom1 = accom %>%
         select(-contains("BHI"), - TIME_LABEL,-UNIT,-INDIC_TO, -NACE_R2 ) %>% ## remove BHI related columns, and other columns that are not needed
         dplyr::rename(year = TIME,
                       nuts = GEO, 
                       nuts_name = GEO_LABEL,
                       dat_descrip = INDIC_TO_LABEL,
                       unit = UNIT_LABEL,
                       dat_descrip2 = NACE_R2_LABEL,
                       value = Value,
                       flag_notes = Flag.and.Footnotes) %>%
          mutate(value = ifelse(value == ":", NA, value)) %>%
          mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) %>%
  mutate(dat_descrip = "Nights spent total",
                      dat_descrip2 = "Hotels and holiday and other short-stay accommodation and camping grounds recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks" ) ## fix so no commas or semi-colons

str(accom1)

## check flags
accom1 %>% select(flag_notes) %>% distinct()
accom1 %>% filter(flag_notes %in% c("c","e","u","be","b")) %>% select(year, nuts,value, flag_notes) ## very few apply to Baltic countries, u is biggest concern = "low reliability"
accom1 %>% filter(flag_notes %in% c("u","bu")) %>% select(year, nuts,value, flag_notes) ## not baltic countries

accom1 = accom1 %>%
        select(-flag_notes)
```

##### Coastal / non-coastal data

Clean to get NUTS1 - higher resolution available for some areas (parts of Finland, German, Poland) but is not consistent. However, NUTS1 does differ among countries. In Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania: NUTS1 is the entire country. *Note for Denmark: this means non-Baltic coast is included*

In Finland, Aland is one region and the rest of the country is another.

In Sweden there are 3 regions in the entire country, and 1 region includes non-Baltic coast. All have substantial inland area.

Germany and Poland each have 2 regions that are NUTS1 that border the Baltic.

![See NUTS1 locations here](nuts1_regions_eurostat_image.png?raw=true)

``` r
## Coastal / non-coastal data
## need to remove the BHI_ID columns - these are from an old join to the BHI shapefile, not relevant now.
## need to rename columns
## these data are at multiple spatial resolutions, need to figure out finest scale resolution, export and do manually.  Differs by country. Also differs within Germany.

# str(accom_coast)

accom_coast1 = accom_coast %>%
         select(-contains("BHI"), -TERRTYPO, - TIME_LABEL, -UNIT, -INDIC_TO, -NACE_R2 ) %>% ## remove BHI related columns, and other columns that are not needed

          mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

# str(accom_coast1)

accom_coast %>% select(TERRTYPO, TERRTYPO_LABEL) %>% distinct()

## figure out which are the NUTS1 abbreviations from the other NUTS level abbreviations, select only NUTS1
accom_coast2 = accom_coast1 %>%

                      dat_descrip2 = "Hotels and holiday and other short-stay accommodation and camping grounds recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks" ) %>% ## fix so no commas or semi-colons
                mutate(nuts0 = substr(nuts, 1, 2),
                       nuts1 = substr(nuts, 1, 3),
                       nuts1 = ifelse(nuts0==nuts1, NA, nuts1),
                       nuts_select = ifelse(nuts1 == nuts, 1, 0)) %>% ## select data that are NUTS1
                filter(nuts_select == 1 ) %>% 
                select(-nuts_select,-nuts,-nuts0,-nuts_name) 
                     
## check flags
# accom_coast2 %>% select(flag_notes) %>% distinct() ## b
# accom_coast2 %>% filter(flag_notes == "b") ## just for 2012 for LV and LT

accom_coast2 = accom_coast2 %>%
               select(-flag_notes) %>%
               select(country, country_abb, nuts1, year, location, value, unit, dat_descrip, dat_descrip2)

# head(accom_coast2)
```

##### NUTS2 population data

``` r
## nuts2 population data
#str(nuts2_pop_area)

nuts2_pop_area1 = nuts2_pop_area %>%
                  select(-PopUrb,-PopRur,-PopUrb_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2,-PopRur_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2, -HELCOM_ID) %>%
                  dplyr::rename(rgn_id = BHI_ID,
                                nuts2 = NUTS_ID,
                                pop = PopTot,
                                pop_km2 = PopTot_density_in_NUTS2_buffer_per_km2,
                                country_abb= CNTR_CODE,
                                country = rgn_nam,
                                basin = Subbasin,
                                area = NUTS2_area_in_BHI_buffer_km2) %>% 
                  mutate(country_abb = substr(nuts2, 1, 2)) #change three letter code to two letter code 

# str(nuts2_pop_area1)
```

#### 4.1.3 Check NUTS2 names from Finland

Shapefiles have names from 2006, check accom1 and accom_coast1 to see if the names have been updated, will need to fix.

![Map of old NUTS2 names for GUlf of Finland](BHI_regions_NUTS2_plot.png?raw=true)

![Map of new NUTS2 names for GUlf of Finland](new_FI_nuts2.png?raw=true)

``` r
accom1 %>% filter(grepl("FI", nuts)) %>% select(nuts, nuts_name) %>% distinct()
## These are the newer region names : FI1B, FI1C, FI1D

accom_coast1 %>% filter(grepl("FI", nuts)) %>% select(nuts, nuts_name) %>% distinct()
## These are the newer region names : FI1B, FI1C, FI1D

nuts2_pop_area1 %>% filter(grepl("FI", nuts2)) %>% select(nuts2) %>% distinct()
## These are the older region names: FI18, FI1A

## Challenge because of coasts
## FI1C is associated with both the Gulf of Finland and the Aland Sea. FI1B has a small fraction associated with Aland Sea, the rest is Gulf of Finland

## Old FI18, contains both FI1C and FI1B.  May need to combine data from the new regions, and apply fraction from the older region.  Helsinki is in FI1B, which would assign almost entirely to BHI 32 and whereas FI1C would divide more equally btween BHI 36 and BHI 32. Therefore, combining these regions in order to apply the division generated from the old region may have a different result.

## old FI1A seems to be the same along the coast as the new FI1D but new FI1D covers inland areas previously in FI13

## Do this after joining accom and accom_coast with the nuts2_pop_area data, will have to add these regions back in.
```

#### 4.1.4 Check for incorrectly assigned NUTS2 regions to BHI regions and fix

Note - (as in NUTS3 assignment issues see ECO)

``` r
## write to csv, fix manually, re-import csv
misassigned_nuts2 = nuts2_pop_area1 %>% select(nuts2,country,rgn_id)

#write.csv(misassigned_nuts2 , file.path(dir_tr, "misassigned_nuts2.csv"), row.names=FALSE)

## read in corrected assignments

corrected_nuts2 = read.csv(file.path(dir_tr,"misassigned_nuts2_manually_corrected.csv"),sep=";",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%       rbind(c("PL63","Poland", as.integer(21),NA,NA, "", as.integer(21), 'Poland')) %>%
      mutate(rgn_id = as.integer((rgn_id)),
             X.correct_BH_ID = as.integer(X.correct_BH_ID))

## join nuts2_pop_area1 with corrected data and fix

nuts2_pop_area2 = nuts2_pop_area1 %>%
                  full_join(., corrected_nuts2,
                            by=c("rgn_id","nuts2","country")) %>%
                 select(-country,-rgn_id,-incorrect,-BHI_ID_manual, -X.country_manual) %>%
                 dplyr::rename(country =X.correct_country,
                               rgn_id = X.correct_BH_ID) %>%
                  select(rgn_id,nuts2,country,country_abb,basin,pop,pop_km2,area) %>%
                  group_by(rgn_id, nuts2, country,country_abb,basin) %>%
                  summarise(pop =sum(pop),
                            pop_km2 = sum(pop_km2),
                            area = sum(area)) %>% ## some regions occurr twice because of correcting the assignment, sum to get single value for each region
                  ungroup()


# str(nuts2_pop_area2)
```

### 4.2 Join datasets {#join-datasets}

#### 4.2.1 Join accom times series with nuts pop and area

Join data with inner join, this will exclude Finland areas with name mismatches. Fix Finnish data and add back into the dataset.

``` r
accom_nuts1 = inner_join(accom1, nuts2_pop_area2,
                         by=c("nuts"="nuts2")) %>%

# dim(accom1)##11250     8
# dim(nuts2_pop_area2) ## 60 8
# dim(accom_nuts1) ##1400  14

# str(accom_nuts1) ## this is now missing the Finnish data where there are name discrepancies

## Get Finnish data renamed so that accommodating and population data match
fi_accom_newnuts = accom1 %>%
                   filter(nuts %in% c("FI1C","FI1B", "FI1D"))

                           nuts_name_old= ifelse(nuts == "FI1C" | nuts == "FI1B","old region",nuts_name )) %>%
                    select(-nuts, -nuts_name) %>%
                    dplyr::rename(nuts=nuts_old,
                                  nuts_name = nuts_name_old) %>%
                    group_by(year,nuts,nuts_name,dat_descrip,unit,dat_descrip2) %>%
                    summarise(value = sum(value)) %>% ## combine all data from contributing sources into old FI unit

# head(fi_accom_newnuts1) ## there are NA but were NA for all regions in those years

## join fi accom to fi pop and area

fi_accom_correct_nuts = full_join(fi_accom_newnuts1, fi_nuts_oldnuts,
                          by=c("nuts"="nuts2")) %>%

### 6.8 Issues or Concerns with Alternative 1 {#issues-or-concerns-with-alternative-1}

### Shapefile assignment issues {#shapefile-assignment-issues}

#### Able to fix manually

See \#### 4.1.4 \#### Not able to fix mannually BHI region 21 not assigned to any NUTS2 regions - despite clear association with PL63. PL63 split only between BHI 17 and BHI 18

### Name discrepancies between datasets {#name-discrepancies-between-datasets}

#### Finnish NUTS2 renamed

See \#### 4.1.3 Shapefiles have names from 2006, accommodation datasets have newer names ![Map of old NUTS2 names for GUlf of Finland](BHI_regions_NUTS2_plot.png?raw=true) ![Map of new NUTS2 names for GUlf of Finland](new_FI_nuts2.png?raw=true)

Challenge because of coasts: New FI1C is associated with both the Gulf of Finland and the Aland Sea. New FI1B has a small fraction associated with Aland Sea, the rest is Gulf of Finland. Old FI18, contains both FI1C and FI1B.

Old FI1A seems to be the same along the coast as the new FI1D but new FI1D covers inland areas previously in FI13

Solution: Combine data from the new regions (FI1C and FI1B), and apply population fraction from the older region (FI18). Apply FI1A old fraction to new (FI1D)

Downsides to this solution: Helsinki is in FI1B, which would assign almost entirely to BHI 32 and whereas FI1C would divide more equally between BHI 36 and BHI 32. Therefore, combining these regions in order to apply the division generated from the old region may have a different result.

### Spatial resolution of coastal allocation. {#spatial-resolution-of-coastal-allocation.}

Differs among countries. Within Germany, NUTS area available differs.

## 7. Explore Alternative 2 {#explore-alternative-2}

The [“Study on Blue Growth, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region”](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550) identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States of the Baltic Sea Region, and also provided detailed marine revenue and employment by sector and in each BHI country. Saved in `prep/LIV/liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv`

Reference point is set to 2020, based on 2.2% annual growth from 2010 for the ten years.

### 7.1 Status Calculation {#status-calculation}

``` r
#### Status ####

# read in blue growth data
blue_data <- read_csv(file.path(dir_prep, 'LIV/liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv')) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(employment)) %>% 
  data.frame(.) %>% 
  select(country, sub_sector, employment) %>% 
  filter(sub_sector %in% c('Coastal tourism', 'Yachting and maris', 'Cruise tourism')) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(total_employ = sum(employment)) 

blue_tr_status <- blue_data %>% 
  mutate(ref_point = total_employ * (1.022^10), # set reference point
         score = total_employ / ref_point *100) 
  
  
# country and BHI regions lookup table
bhi_lookup = read.csv(file.path(dir_prep, "LIV/bhi_basin_country_lookup.csv"), sep=";",stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
            select(rgn_nam, BHI_ID) %>%
            dplyr::rename(country= rgn_nam,
                          rgn_id = BHI_ID)

blue_tr_status <- full_join(bhi_lookup, blue_tr_status, by = "country") %>% 
  select(rgn_id, score) %>% 
  mutate(dimension = "status")

### NTOE: rgn 19, 22, 33 don't have scores because there was no data for Russia

# save as data layer
write_csv(blue_tr_status, file.path(dir_layers, "tr_status_scores_bhi2015.csv"))
```

### 7.2 Trend Calculation {#trend-calculation}

Trend is based on the same Blue Growth report as in status calculations. Trend score for each country is weighted average of % growth in employment in each subsector (*Coastal tourism, Yachting and maris, Cruise tourism*), by their relative contribution to the total GVA in Tourism and Recreation.

``` r
blue_tr_trend <- read_csv(file.path(dir_prep, 'LIV/liv_data_database/BHI_employ_revenue_by_country_2010.csv')) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(employment)) %>% 
  data.frame(.) %>% 
  select(country, sub_sector, revenue, emp_growth_rate) %>% 
  filter(sub_sector %in% c('Coastal tourism', 'Yachting and maris', 'Cruise tourism')) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(total_rev = sum(revenue),
  rel_contribut = revenue/total_rev) %>% # calculate relative contribution based on revenue
  summarize(score = sum(emp_growth_rate * rel_contribut)/100) # weighted average of employment growth rate
  
blue_tr_trend <- full_join(bhi_lookup, blue_tr_trend, by = "country") %>% 
  select(rgn_id, score) %>% 
  mutate(dimension = "trend")

write_csv(blue_tr_trend, file.path(dir_layers, "tr_trend_scores_bhi2015.csv"))
```

### 7.3 Plot status and trend {#plot-status-and-trend}

``` r
blue_tr_results = bind_rows(blue_tr_status,blue_tr_trend)

blue_tr_plot = ggplot(blue_tr_results) +
  geom_point(aes(rgn_id,score),size=2.5) +
  facet_wrap(~dimension, scales = "free_y") +
  ylab("Score") +
  ggtitle("TR Status and Trend - Alt 2 (Blue Growth report)")

print(blue_tr_plot)
```
