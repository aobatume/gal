# Summary

This script prepares the RAM B/Bmsy data:
1. Relevant data are collected from the RAM database
2. Missing years are gapfilled when appropriate
3. RAM and SAUP species names are harmonized in a few cases
4. RAM stocks are associated with the corresponding OHI and FAO regions


## Updates from previous assessment

- Updated RAM data for v2024


***

For this data prep we primarily use and consult `timeseries_values_views`, `tsmetrics`, and `metadata`
```{r load_data, eval = FALSE}

# histogram of all years and how many stocks have their latest year of data in that year
hist(test$num_max_yrs,breaks=18)
hist(test$max_year,breaks=18)

sum(test$num_max_yrs) # 474 total stocks

plot(test) # 203 stocks have data until 2019, but that is out of 474 stocks (lots need to be gapfilled)
```

## Gapfill RAM data when there are missing years

For each stock: 
 - If you are upfilling you carry over the most recent years value (i.e. data only goes to 2016, you upfill 2017, 2018, and 2019 with the 2016 value)
 - If you are back filling, you backfill using the value of the oldest most recent year (i.e. you only have values for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019... you give 2005-2015 the 2016 value)
 - If you are in-between-filling, you use linear approximation (zoo::na.approx) (i.e. you have 2005-2010 and 2016-2019... fill in 2011-2015 using na.approx)
 - To be included in this carry-over type gapfilling you have to have a maximum year of 2010 or greater (regardless of the number of years of data... so if you only have 1 year of data, for 2010, then that gets carried over all the way to 2019, or vice-versa)

## Identify FAO and OHI regions for RAM stocks

Identify the FAO/OHI regions where each RAM stock is located (fao and ohi regions are assigned to RAM Data in [STEP4b_fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/rstudio/files/github/ohiprep_v2023/globalprep/fis/v2023/STEP4b_fao_ohi_rgns.html). **Run STEP4b_fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd now.**


If there are many differences between RAM spatial file and RAM metadata, check the STEP4_fao_ohi_rgns.Rmd prep again. 


```{r final, eval = FALSE}
## Read in RAM spatial stocks file
ram_spatial <- read_csv(here(int_dir, "RAM_fao_ohi_rgns_final.csv"))

ram_meta <- metadata %>% 
  dplyr::select(stockid, stocklong, scientificname)

setdiff(ram_spatial$stockid, ram_meta$stockid) # make sure all the spatial data has corresponding metadata (should be 0). It is not 0, probably because these are ones that have been removed from the RAM database since the 2017 assessment... delete these from the data frame below. 

# v2024: 
#  [1] "HERR2529-33"   "HERR2529-34"   "HERR2529-35"  
#  [4] "HERR2529-36"   "HERR2529-37"   "HERR30-32"    
#  [7] "SOLEIIIa-2225" "SOLEIIIa-2226" "SOLEIIIa-2227"
# [10] "SOLEIIIa-2228"

# join with metadata to get scientific name
ram_spatial_meta <- ram_spatial %>%
  dplyr::select(-stocklong) %>%
  left_join(ram_meta, by = c("stockid")) %>%
  rename(RAM_species = scientificname) %>%
  filter(!is.na(stocklong)) ## filtering out ones that didn't match above

setdiff(ram_spatial_meta$stockid, ram_meta$stockid) # v2024: now it is 0, we can move on
```

## Standardize species names

In most cases, the RAM and SAUP data use the same species names, but there are a few exceptions.  The following code identifies species in the RAM data that are not in the SAUP data. In these cases, different species names may be used (although not necessarily because some of the species may be present in RAM, but not SAUP, for other reasons). For these species, I used fishbase to explore synonyms and create a table to harmonize the RAM species names with the SAUP species names (saved as: int/RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv).

```{r name harmonize, eval = FALSE}
ram_bmsy_gf_final <- read_csv(here(int_dir, "ram_stock_bmsy_gf.csv"))

# get list of RAM species, scientific name
ram_sp <- ram_bmsy_gf_final %>%
  left_join(data.frame(metadata), by = "stockid") %>%
  dplyr::select(scientificname) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(scientificname)

# SAUP species, sci name (read in the datatable that includes TaxonKey)
SAUP_sp <- read_csv(here(dir_M,"git-annex","globalprep","fis","v2022","int","stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv")) %>% # use most recent one available
  dplyr::rename(SAUP_scientificname = TaxonName) %>%
  dplyr::select(SAUP_scientificname) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(SAUP_scientificname)


# compare names - what's in RAM that's not in SAUP
tmp <- data.frame(scientificname = sort(setdiff(ram_sp$scientificname, SAUP_sp$SAUP_scientificname))) # 40 species names

# compare names - what's in SAUP that's not in RAM
tmp2 <- data.frame(scientificname = sort(setdiff(SAUP_sp$SAUP_scientificname, ram_sp$scientificname))) # 2343 species names.. unfortunately a lot.

write_csv(tmp, here(int_dir, "unmatched_RAM_species.csv"))
write_csv(tmp2, here(int_dir, "SAUP_species_no_RAM.csv"))


## join ram spatial with RAM species on scientific name. We can use this to help check whether questionable species names across the ram and SAUP data match by region and fao id...
ram_sp_fao_ohi <- tmp %>%
  left_join(ram_spatial_meta, by = c("scientificname" = "RAM_species")) %>%
  unique() 

write_csv(ram_sp_fao_ohi, here(int_dir, "new_ram_sp.csv"))  

## get SAUP fao_ohi regions
SAUP_sp_fao_ohi <- read_csv(here(dir_M, "git-annex","globalprep","fis","v2022","int", "stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv")) %>% # use most recent one available
  dplyr::rename(SAUP_scientificname = TaxonName) %>%
  dplyr::filter(year > 1979) # %>%
  # filter(str_detect(SAUP_scientificname, "Mullus"))

# manually copy the below file from the previous year to the current version
RAM_species_to_SAUP <- read_csv(here(int_dir, "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv"))

# Then I hand-looked up each of the missing ones from "unmatched_RAM_species.csv", and added those new ones to "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv" to generate this list - most still unmatched.

setdiff(tmp$scientificname, RAM_species_to_SAUP$RAM_species) ## these are the new species to add to "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv".
# v2024: [1] "Mullus barbatus": could not find 

# v2024 adding new species (change to relevant species for current year):
species_to_add <- data.frame(
  RAM_species = c("Mullus barbatus"),
  SAUP_species = c("Mullus barbatus barbatus")
) 

RAM_species_to_SAUP_updated <- rbind(RAM_species_to_SAUP, species_to_add)

write_csv(RAM_species_to_SAUP_updated, here(int_dir, "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv")

ram_name_corr <- read_csv(here(int_dir, "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv")) %>%
   filter(!is.na(SAUP_species))  # SAUP to RAM name conversion

ram_name_corr # matched species, unfortunately only 13
```


### Final formatting

Harmonize names between RAM and SAUP data.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# correct names in a few cases to match with SAUP names
ram_name_corr <- read_csv(here(int_dir, "RAM_species_to_SAUP.csv")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(SAUP_species)) # SAUP to RAM name conversion

ram_spatial <- ram_spatial_meta %>%
  left_join(ram_name_corr, by="RAM_species") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(species = ifelse(!is.na(SAUP_species), SAUP_species, RAM_species)) %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_id, fao_id, stockid, stocklong, species, RAM_area_m2)

length(unique(ram_spatial$stockid)) # v2024: 498 RAM stocks with B/Bmsy data
length(unique(ram_spatial$species)) # v2024: 237
```


Re-name `stockid` column to `stockid_ram` and create new column `stockid` that matches with the `stockid` column in the CMSY data table prepared in [STEP3_calculate_bbmsy.Rmd](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2021/master/globalprep/fis/v2021/STEP3_calculate_bbmsy.html).

# v2023 and v2024: for some reason SFMAKOSATL and HERR4RFA are not in ram_spatial. SFMAKOSATL was determined to be because the fishing/OHI region, the US, is not in the FAOs of the South Atlantic, so this one is ok. HERR4RFA seemed to also show up in v2023 and v2021, so it is uncertain why this one was not in ram_spatial, and it will be manually added in. Could not find RAM_area_m2 info for it so putting NA, which is consistent with HERR4RSP.
