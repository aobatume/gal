# Summary

This script takes the SAUP 2022 catch data, provided at a resolution of per SAUP region/year/species totals, and creates 3 data layers:

1. Catch data aggregated to **stock levels** to calculate B/Bmsy values. For the Ocean Health Index, we assume a stock is represented by the FAO region in which the species is caught.  We also use these data to aggregate to OHI/FAO region to weight the B/Bmsy values. In order to aggregate to FAO regions, we associate each cell to the FAO region and the OHI region in which it is located.

An example of our aggregation process: New Zealand is located entirely in FAO region 81. All catch reported by New Zealand will be aggregated by species to the FAO region. If a species was reported as caught in both New Zealand waters and in the High Seas of area 81, these two records will be combined into one by summing the catch.

2. An average catch dataset used to weight B/Bmsy values in the fisheries model. For this dataset, the catch is assigned to FAO and OHI regions.

3. Average catch over time for each region for food provision weighting.

First, we need to match SAUP EEZ regions to OHI regions, and summarize per region, year, and species.

## Updates from previous assessment
- None. This script wasn't run in v2024. Associated data files within the repo were copied from v2023 to v2024.

# Aggregate catch

Aggregate catch per OHI region and FAO area. This catch will be used twice. 

(1) The catch is used to weight scores per region. For this we need to use catch records, including those not reported at the species level. See note below.

(2) The catch data at species level is used to calculate stock status (BBmsy) per stock (remember that our definition of a stock is a species caught within a single FAO area) For this, we will include discards and "Other" end use type, as well as FOFM species.


Note:  Save IUU and Reported landings only (`CatchTotal`) as the catch sum. This is different from v2018, which saved it as IUU, Reported, and Discards.

## Add Taxon Key Information

Need taxon key to easily remove higher level (e.g. genus) taxonomic catch data. Unique taxon key was extracted from Watson 2019 (v5) Codes.xlsx, sheet name "Taxa" and from our old (v2016/v2017) SAUP data (taxon keys were provided directly from SAUP).

Must have taxon key match for every stock. If some are not matched, do it manually by searching the SAUP website.

Look at which entries that don't have a Taxon key match. Search taxon in [Sea Around Us](http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/topic/biodiversity) website. Click on "View graph for catches of _Taxon Name_" link in the results. It'll take you to a new page. The Taxon key is the six digit code in the url.

**Note:** for v2022, all we will need to do is to grab v2021's taxon_key_v2021.csv, and use that as our taxonkey lookup df (i.e. the "taxon_key_SAUP_watson" dataframe)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

I emailed SAUP about obtaining all of the keys, so hopefully that will happen so we can make this prep more tidy. For now, lets write the list of no taxon keys to a csv, and start manually looking them up on SAUPs website...

## Wrangle

Filter out all stocks that don't meet our conditions. This prep will be used for B/Bmsy calculations. We will include ALL catch here (including discards):

(1) Keep all stocks that have at least an average annual harvest of 1000 tons
(2) Keep all stocks with time series of 20 years or more


```{r prep_data_bbmsy, eval=FALSE}
## KEEP DISCARDS, FOFM, and OTHER FOR THIS DF (THIS DF IS FOR BBMSY CALCS)

```

# Prep data for B/Bmsy calculations

Catch-MSY is the model we use to estimate stock status for all global stocks. This model requires information about the resilience of each species in addition to the catch data for each year.

**NOW WE RUN THE `species_resilience_lookup_table.Rmd` SCRIPT**

Load taxonomic resilience information, created in `species_resilience_lookup_table.Rmd`. The species resilience prep (species_resilience_lookup_table.Rmd) resulted 10 more resilience information rows this year than in 2019.

```{r resilience,eval=F}

## add the taxon_resilence data to catch for b/bmsy calculations
taxon_res = read_csv('output/taxon_resilience_lookup.csv') %>%
              dplyr::select(CommonName=common, Resilience)

```

## More Wrangling
 - Add the resilience information to the stks dataframe created above, and re-write it to the output folder. 
 
```{r prep_data_bbmsy1, eval=FALSE}

# Prep data for mean catch 

## Wrangle

Mean catch data is used to weight the B/Bmsy values in the fishery subgoal.

```{r mean catch, eval=F}
## FOR THIS WE WILL EXCLUDE DISCARDS, FOFM, and OTHER 

file <- file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2022/int/stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv')

catch <- read_csv(file) %>%
  rename(common = CommonName, fao_id = fao_rgn, species=TaxonName) 


summary(catch)

test <- catch %>%
  filter(rgn_id == 21)


## filter out non ohi eez regions 
catch <- catch %>%
  filter(!is.na(rgn_id)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(fao_id)) %>%
  filter(rgn_id <= 250) %>%
  filter(rgn_id != 213)

sum(catch$tons) # 6095900083

## exclude discards and "other" end use type
catch <- catch %>% 
  filter(discard_id == 0) %>%
  filter(other_id == 0)

sum(catch$tons) # 5268820702
5268820702/6095900083 # makes sense.


## calculate total annual catch for each stock
catch <- catch %>%
  dplyr::select(year, rgn_id, fao_id, stock_id, TaxonKey, tons) %>% # this is where we would add fofm_id, but I'm not doing it for 2021, because the fofm_id numbers look very wrong for 2016-2018
  group_by(rgn_id, fao_id, TaxonKey, stock_id, year) %>%
  summarize(catch = sum(tons)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

Take a look at a few stocks.
```{r, eval=FALSE}

data.frame(dplyr::filter(catch, stock_id == "Zygochlamys_patagonica-87" & rgn_id==172))
data.frame(dplyr::filter(catch, stock_id == "Marine_fishes_not_identified-57" & rgn_id==1))

```

## Fill in Zeros
For years with no reported catch, add zero values (after first reported catch)

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## these data have no zero catch values, so add years with no reported catch to data table:
catch_zeros <- catch %>%
  spread(year, catch) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  gather("year", "catch", num_range("X", min(catch$year):max(catch$year))) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(gsub("X", "", year))) %>%
  mutate(catch = ifelse(is.na(catch), 0, catch))

## this part eliminates the zero catch values prior to the first reported non-zero catch   
catch_zeros <- catch_zeros %>%
  group_by(fao_id, TaxonKey, stock_id, rgn_id) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(cum_catch = cumsum(catch)) %>%
  filter(cum_catch > 0) %>%
  dplyr::select(-cum_catch) %>%
  ungroup()

test <- catch_zeros %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(sum = sum(catch))

```

## Calculate Mean Catch
Calculate mean catch for ohi regions (using data from 1980 onward). These data are used to weight the RAM b/bmsy values. We will also correct for the forage fish used for feed/fish oil by excluding the proportion used for non-human purposes, like animal feed (90% of forage fish catch). 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

## correcting for forage fish used as feed/fish oil
## We have traditionally included all fisheries catch in the Food Provision goal. However, a substantial portion of catch is used in animal feed. Our plan is to remove a portion of catch of these species from the fisheries goal.

## read in list of species used for feed
forage_fish_taxa_list <- read_csv(file.path("raw/forage_fish_taxa_list.csv"))

taxon_key_info <- read_csv(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2022/int/stock_catch_by_rgn_taxa.csv'))

## need to get TaxonKey's for each species to join with catch_zeros
forage_fish_taxa_list <- forage_fish_taxa_list %>%
  left_join(taxon_key_info, by = c("forage_fish" = "TaxonName")) %>%
  dplyr::select(forage_fish, inWatson, TaxonKey) %>%
  unique()

 
prop_human_cons <- 0.1 ## source from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0077-1#Sec11: "Currently, it is estimated about 10% of forage fish enter the human diet directly, but the notoriously tiny-boned fish are labour intensive (thus expensive) to process for human consumption, are the foundation of several industries and thus jobs (creating inertia to change) and are not the preferred fish type for most people"

## join this with catch_zeros by species, and multiply by 0.1... this is the proportion of catch used for humans 
catch_zero_minus_fish_feed <- forage_fish_taxa_list %>%
  left_join(catch_zeros, by = "TaxonKey") %>%
  mutate(catch_human = prop_human_cons*catch,
         catch_fish_feed = catch*(1-prop_human_cons))

This states that forage fish account for more than a third of fish catch every year: https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2013/pffforagefishfaq.pdf

# Prep data for food provision weights 

These data determine the tonnes of food provided by fisheries.  Ultimately, the proportion of food from fisheries relative to mariculture will be calculated to weight the contributions of fishery and mariculture scores to final food provision scores.
